### Personal Summary
Coding is a very exciting field to be in because there are endlessly ways to be creative when designing a new application. It also provides unique and challenging problems that I enjoy working through on a daily basis. I am a deep-thinker and a hard-worker which means I can thrive independently. But, I consider myself a dynamic individual, because I love working with others doing pair-programming or group programming, because I like hearing about different ways of thinking and connecting with like-minded people. I am very enthusiastic about learning new concepting and understanding all that I can.
